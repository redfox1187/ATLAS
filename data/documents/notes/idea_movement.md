Movement Ideas

Mobility Interference - Long weapons, heavy weapons, heavy armors- these all have levels of mobility interference, mobint.
A piece of equipment's mobint is a value that stacks, reducing the effectiveness of moving around and over obstacles. This is to simulate the difficulty of operating with heavy or awkward equipment. This can potentially be expanded to be included on wounds or other factors that might reduce a character's agility.
